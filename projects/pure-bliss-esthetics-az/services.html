					<div class="popup">CAN BE ADDED ON TO ANY SERVICE! High Frequency generates an electrical current that has a gentle and safe, oscillating oxygenating power. It is used by skin professionals to help treat and prevent stubborn acne, reduce enlarged pores back to their original state, minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, decongest puffy eyes, rejuvenate the condition of the beard and scalp, and nourish hair follicles for healthier hair growth. For anti-aging purposes, high frequency treatments stimulate cell renewal and increase circulation to stimulate collagen production, as well as improve skin care product penetration and absorption. For acne and congested skin purposes, the application of high frequency current to the skin kills bacteria and reduces inflammation, which helps treat existing acne and prevent the onset of new acne.</div>
