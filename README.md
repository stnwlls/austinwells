# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Austin Wells**, a passionate first-year web development student at South Mountain Community College. I'm based in Phoenix, AZ, and specialize in creating beautiful and functional websites using the latest web technologies.

I've learned HTML and CSS so far, and I'm eager to expand my skills with more technologies. My entire portfolio will reflect the projects and pieces I've created throughout my journey in school.

With a keen eye for detail, I strive to deliver high-quality web experiences that not only meet but exceed expectations.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and check out some of the projects I've worked on. If you like what you see, don't hesitate to get in touch!
